# StochasticityBW
Code for reproducing the results of our accpeted CVPR 2020 paper (Oral):

**An Investigation of Stochasticity of Batch Whitening** 

Lei Huang, Lei Zhao, Yi Zhou, Fan Zhu, Li Liu, Ling Shao

We provide the Pytorch and Tensorfollow implementations of different whitening methods. 
* `SBW_Classification_PyTorch`: reproduces the discriminative classification experiments
* `SBW_GAN_TF`: reproduce the GAN experiments.
